Assignment 3: 

This assignment implements a basic Student Registrar System using Object-Oriented Programming. The system allows students to enroll in courses, drop courses, display available courses, and assign grades. It also calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the grades a student receives.

Exercises

Exercise 1: Enroll Students in Courses
In this exercise, the Student and Course classes were created. Students can enroll in multiple courses, with checks in place to prevent duplicate enrollments.

Exercise 2: Drop Courses
This exercise adds functionality to allow students to drop courses they are enrolled in. The system ensures that only courses a student is enrolled in can be dropped.

Exercise 3: Display All Students and Courses
Here, methods are added to display lists of all registered students and available courses.

Exercise 4: Adding Grades and GPA Calculation

This exercise expands the system to assign grades to students for each course and calculate their GPA based on a standard 4.0 grading scale.
